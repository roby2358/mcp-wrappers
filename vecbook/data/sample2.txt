This document discusses vector databases and semantic search.

---

Vector databases store high-dimensional vector representations of data, enabling efficient similarity search and retrieval.

---

Semantic search goes beyond keyword matching to understand the meaning and context of queries.

---

Embedding models convert text, images, or other data into numerical vectors that capture semantic meaning.
