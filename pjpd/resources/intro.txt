Welcome to ProjectMCP - Local Project Management Server

ProjectMCP is a lightweight, local-first project management system built on plain .txt files. It provides task tracking, prioritization, and project overview capabilities through an MCP interface.

Key Features:
• Task management with plain integer priority levels
• Project organization with separate .txt files
• Simple, human-readable task format
• MCP tools for adding, listing, updating, and completing tasks
• Project overviews and next steps recommendations
• Comprehensive statistics and reporting
• Ignore file support for filtering project files

Task Format:
Each task is stored with a unique 10-character ID, priority level, status (ToDo/Done), and description, separated by "---" lines.

Priority Levels:
• Higher numbers = higher priority (e.g., priority 100 is higher than priority 1)
• Plain integer values stored with 4-digit formatting in files
• Flexible priority system allowing any integer value

Available MCP Tools:

Core Project Management:
• pjpd_new_project - Create a new empty project file
• pjpd_list_projects - List all projects with task counts and overview (optional path parameter)

Task Operations:
• pjpd_add_task - Create new tasks with project, description, and priority
• pjpd_list_tasks - List tasks with optional filtering by project, priority, status, or max_results
• pjpd_update_task - Update existing task description, priority, or status
• pjpd_mark_done - Mark a task as completed

Analysis and Reporting:
• pjpd_next_steps - Determine high-priority tasks to work on next
• pjpd_get_statistics - Get comprehensive statistics about all projects

System Information:
• pjpd_intro - Return this introductory description (prompt)

Configuration:
Projects are stored as .txt files in the projects directory (~/projects by default), with each project having its own file. You can specify a custom path when using pjpd_list_projects. The system automatically creates project files when you add your first task to a new project, or you can create empty project files using the pjpd_new_project tool.

The system supports a pjpdignore file in the projects directory under pjpd/ to filter out specific project files, and all configuration is managed through projectmcp.toml.

This system modifies local files on disk. Before using any tools that create, update, or modify project files, please remind the user to back up any important data. Obtain their consent make file modifications. 

Start by listing projects in the current working directory.
