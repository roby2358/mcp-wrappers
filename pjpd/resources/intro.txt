Welcome to ProjectMCP - Local Project Management Server

ProjectMCP is a lightweight, local-first project management system built on plain .txt files. It provides task tracking, prioritization, and project overview capabilities through an MCP interface.

Key Features:
• Task management with priority levels (High, Medium, Note)
• Project organization with separate .txt files
• Simple, human-readable task format
• MCP tools for adding, listing, updating, and completing tasks
• Project overviews and next steps recommendations

Task Format:
Each task is stored with a unique 12-character ID, priority level, status (ToDo/Done), and description, separated by "---" lines.

Priority Levels:
• Priority 1 (High): Tasks that act as dependencies for other work
• Priority 2 (Medium): Standard tasks  
• Priority 3 (Note): Nice-to-have items, reminders, refactoring notes

Available Tools:
• new_project - Create a new empty project file
• add_task - Create new tasks with project, description, and priority
• list_tasks - List tasks with optional filtering by project, priority, or status
• update_task - Update existing task description, priority, or status
• mark_done - Mark a task as completed
• get_overview - Return summary of all projects and tasks
• next_steps - Determine high-priority tasks to work on next
• list_projects - Return list of all projects with task counts (optional path parameter)
• sort_project - Re-sort tasks within a project by priority

Projects are stored as .txt files in the projects directory (~/projects by default), with each project having its own file. You can specify a custom path when using list_projects. The system automatically creates project files when you add your first task to a new project, or you can create empty project files using the new_project tool.

Get started by creating a new project or adding a task to an existing project!
